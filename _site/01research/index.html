<!-- ### Intergenerational transfers in the U.S., economic inequality, and social stratification (with [Alberto Palloni](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/soc/faculty/show-person.php?person_id=38))

<blockquote>This paper contributes to the literature on intergenerational transfers in three ways. First, we estimate prevalence, direction and magnitudes of money transfers from parents to children (PtC) in the U.S. over a period of nearly 18 years (1992-2010). Second, we use these estimates to test the conjecture that an important, albeit not the only, motive for transfers is socioeconomic status preservation. Third, we show that although the quantities of intervivos transfers are small relative to bequests, they are unequally distributed and large enough to exert some influence on intergenerational mobility. We use ten waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and estimate models of PtC within parent-child dyads, account for within-household dependency of multiple transfers, for reciprocal influence of PtC transfers to siblings, and for the influence of transfers in the opposite direction, from children to parents (CtP). We uncover sharp inequalities in PtC transfers by wealth class and amounts that are not trivial, particularly in the wealthiest groups. We conclude that both the skewness of PtC distribution and the absolute magnitudes involved could potentially affect income and wealth inequalities in successive generations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We test the conjecture that intergenerational social mobility is tightly linked to adult mortality even after accounting for income levels, income inequality, and indicators of social capital, health behaviors and levels of access to health services. We use a large dataset from The Health Inequality Project and estimate simple multivariate models with U.S. counties and commuting zones as units of analysis. We find that the estimated effects of indicators of social mobility are strong and in the expected direction, robust to model specification, and translate into differences in life expectancy at age 40 as large 2.0-4.8 years among males and 0.1-2.0 among females. These are equivalent to 5.1-12.5 and 0.2-4.7 percent of the U.S. average life expectancy at age 40 among males and females respectively. On average, the magnitude of these effects is 1.5 to 2.5 times as large as those of income inequality and about 40 (males) and 25 (females) percent of the magnitude of a change from the lowest to the highest quartile of the U.S. income distribution.</blockquote>

<!-- ### Exploring the consequences of adolescent sex in behavioral context (with [Eric Grodsky](http://ssc.wisc.edu/soc/faculty/show-person.php?person_id=859) and [Ann Meier](http://www.soc.umn.edu/~meierann/))

<blockquote>A substantial body of research has shown a negative relationship between adolescent sexual activity and outcomes such as self-esteem, depression, and academic achievement. Recent studies, however, suggest that detrimental effects of sexual activity are conditional on the social context in which this behavior occurs and also the meanings youth ascribe to sexual behavior. We add to this literature by considering the configuration of behaviors in which adolescent sex occurs as a marker of the social meaning of sexual intercourse. This paper explores how sexual intercourse, co-occurring with adolescent behaviors commonly regarded as deviant, is related to mental health and schooling outcomes. Our results show little evidence for variation of the relationship between sexual intercourse on these outcomes across behavioral contexts. However, our point estimates for conditional coefficients suggest more confidence in invariant "effects" of sexual activity for typical adolescents than for those engaged in problem behaviors such as substance use and fighting.</blockquote> -->

<blockquote> This paper uses the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) and recent empirical strategies to examine the dynamic consequences of parenthood on delinquency and substance use. We take advantage of the miscarriage information available to form comparison groups. Our contribution is to extend the analysis of the effects of childbearing to deviant outcomes such as delinquency and substance use, and explore the  differences between motherhood and fatherhood. Our preliminary results suggest reductions in risky behaviors from childbearing. We do not find evidence of heterogeneity across socioeconomic status.</blockquote>

<!-- ### Selection / Influence of Adolescent Violence (with [Jason Fletcher](https://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/jason-fletcher))

<blockquote>This paper examines the co-evolution of friendship and violence over a period of five years using a school-based sample of adolescents from Northern Ireland (The Belfast Youth Development Study).  We estimate a dynamic network model to decompose selection and influence effects of violence while controlling for endogenous network change. Given the size of our sample, we can also explore heterogeneity in our estimates across schools and assess to what extent the observed differences are explained by characteristics of the schools such as size, SES, religion, and gender composition. Thus, we contribute to this literature providing selection/influence violence estimates from a considerably larger sample than previous studies and going beyond school idiosyncrasies. Most importantly, we examine how heterogeneous these dynamics are across different local contexts and identify factors that are the most important. These results will, potentially, improve violence prevention strategies in the school context. </blockquote>   -->

<h3 id="exploring-the-dynamic-of-incarceration-and-crime-an-agent-based-modeling-approach-dissertation">Exploring the Dynamic of Incarceration and Crime: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach (Dissertation)</h3>

<blockquote>The expansion of the criminal justice system in the United States over the past four decades has triggered an academic and public discussion about the intended and unintended consequences of incarceration, stressing the limitations of imprisonment as a strategy to prevent crime. This debate is not new and has occupied centuries of scholarship on crime and punishment: Does punishment prevent crime, and if it does, how? Despite well-developed and coherent theories on the incarceration and crime dynamic, empirical evidence to date is far for conclusive. Data limitations and methodological challenges make causal inference and disentangling mechanisms difficult. 

My dissertation project follows a different approach. Instead of providing another causal estimate of incarceration on crime, I use agent-based modeling (ABM) to explore the dynamic of imprisonment and crime at the community level by creating artificial environments based on theory and empirical research. This enables me to examine how and under which conditions the mechanisms discussed in the literature can reproduce the patterns they predict, in addition to exploring hypothetical situations that are not possible to observe in the real world. This project will provide a guide for future research through the identification of the most relevant processes and parameters. These insights can also illuminate the public debate on the consequences of incarceration, and the trade-off between public safety and social and monetary costs.</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-consequences-of-incarceration-for-health-and-mortality-with-alberto-palloni-and-jerrett-jones">The Consequences of Incarceration for Health and Mortality (with Alberto Palloni and Jerrett Jones)</h3>

<blockquote>In light of the expansion of the criminal justice system, researchers have become increasingly interested in the social consequences of incarceration. A line of this research suggests that incarceration has negative implications for individuals’ health and well-being at older ages. However, prior studies are limited in that they have not adequately followed former prisoners over a sufficient time period to determine whether incarceration significantly increases mortality. 

This project contributes to this growing literature by employing the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), a long longitudinal data resource, to examine the consequences of incarceration for health and mortality. First, we estimate the effect of short and long-term effects of incarceration on mortality and disability over a period of nearly 40 years. Second, we use those estimates and different counterfactual scenarios to assess to what extent mass incarceration contributes to the so called U.S. health disadvantage.</blockquote>

<h3 id="chile-re-entry-study-with-pilar-larroulet-and-catalina-droppelmann">Chile Re-entry study (with Pilar Larroulet and Catalina Droppelmann)</h3>

<blockquote>The study, funded by the San Carlos de Maipo Foundation, is an intensive longitudinal data collection of a sample of about 300  women leaving prison in Santiago, Chile. We are using interviews over a period of a year to examine the employment, family life, housing, and health of women just released from prison, but also, qualitative interviews to examine in more detail re-entry experience. We are in the early stages of the project, designing questionnaire and organizing the fieldwork. </blockquote>
